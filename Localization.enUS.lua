The most dangerous part of the fight is when the brambles are healed up and you have to stand in the green circle to avoid the damage from %s. She must also be in the circle but if anyone gets near her during this it will herd her out of it to her death. To counteract this have the assigned herder put her right on one side of the circle and have all other players stand on the other side.\n\n You must also extinguish her before the boss dies, which can only be done in phase 1 so don't push the boss to 35%% before you do so. To extinguish her you need to remove the 50 stacks of %s she has. You do this by killing the %s, which will then become %s and need to be healed. After being healed they will channel into the seed in the middle of the room and give it energy. Once it has energy it can be clicked and lets someone use %s. This is normally used to clear the fire and give you more room for the fight but for this achievement you should stand near %s and remove her stacks. You will need multiple waves of %s to remove all 50 stacks.\n\n Once she's extinguished you can push to phase 2 and then just kill the boss without %s dying.",
