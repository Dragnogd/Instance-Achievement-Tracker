Have 1 person responsible for managing her throughout the fight. She must be herded out of mechanics and fire as the fight goes on and healed if she takes any damage. The most dangerous part of the fight is when the brambles are healed up and you have to stand in the green circle to avoid the damage from %s. She must also be in the circle but if anyone gets near her during this it will herd her out of it to her death. To counteract this have the assigned herder put her right on one side of the circle and have all other players stand on the other side.\n\n You must also extinguish her before the boss dies, which can only be done in phase 1 so don't push the boss to 35%% before you do so. To extinguish her you need to remove the 50 stacks of %s she has. You do this by killing the %s, which will then become %s and need to be healed. After being healed they will channel into the seed in the middle of the room and give it energy. Once it has energy it can be clicked and lets someone use %s. This is normally used to clear the fire and give you more room for the fight but for this achievement you should stand near %s and remove her stacks. You will need multiple waves of %s to remove all 50 stacks.\n\n Once she's extinguished you can push to phase 2 and then just kill the boss without %s dying.",

Each person needs to collect one of them and once you have all 5 the %s will spawn. Once the %s is killed you can kill the boss to get this achievement.\n\n Note: Taking any damage will interrupt the sleeping phase. While most of the damage on the fight is avoidable, the ticking damage from the flowers is not, meaning you have to soak any flower before you try to /sleep or the process will be interrupted.

The people that picked up the water need to take it in turn to walk over a rune and use their extra action button to %s it. The dousing process is an 8 second channel so make sure you're safe before starting as you can't move for the 8 seconds. Once the rune is doused the raid will take ~200k damage from %s, so you'll want to limit it to 1 or 2 runes at a time so no one dies.

On most sets this won't be a problem but on the very last add that spawns it will be almost directly after the %s spawn so it's very easy for him to die. \n\n Once all 6 adds are healed up you can push the boss to last phase and kill him to get this achievement.",

The entire raid will then get hit by the right wave as it moves across the room. It is recommended that the 2 players initially targeted run into their own waves in order to accurately track the achievement.\n\n You will need to continue to have all players soak every wave of %s as the achievement requirements reset each time a new wave spawns.\n\n Note: If a player walks into both waves, this will automatically fail the achievement.
